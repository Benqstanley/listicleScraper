0," “You have to be real with yourself. No one is doing that. People are too concerned with making everything look nice and calm and pretty.” – Donald Glover Writer. Actor. Comedian. Director. Musician. There’s pretty much nothing Donald Glover can’t do. He first came to attention for his work with Derrick Comedy and, with the help of Tina Fey, was hired at the age of 23 to become a writer for the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. He later portrayed community college student Troy Barnes on the NBC sitcom Community. He currently stars in the FX series Atlanta, which he also created. He will appear in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and has been cast as the young Lando Calrissian in the upcoming, untitled standalone Han Solo Star Wars movie. He will also provide the voice of Simba in a remake of the Disney film The Lion King. Here are a few things you might not know about the man some people call Childish Gambino.  30. Mixed Up The first mixtape album that he does acknowledge is 2008’s Sick Boi. On this mixtape, Glover refers to himself as Bambino, as he hadn’t yet settled on the rap name of Childish Gambino and was toying with the idea of naming himself Bambino X. Fans refer to this as his Lil Wayne period.  29. Putting the Spec in Special At the age of 23, Glover was hired by Tina Fey to be a writer on the NBC comedy series 30 Rock.

8, 21. Sail Away Glover left Community during the fifth season when his character took off on a world-circumnavigating sailing trip as a condition of a $14.3 million dollar inheritance left to him by the wealthy Pierce Hawthorne (Chevy Chase).
